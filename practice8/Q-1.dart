//1. Explain what is asynchronous programming in dart?

/* Answer:-
  Asynchronous programming allows your program to perform time-consuming operations 
  (like network requests, file reading, or delays) without blocking the main thread. 
  Dart uses Future, async, and await to handle asynchronous operations.
